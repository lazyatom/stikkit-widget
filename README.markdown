Stikkit Widget
==============


This is a fairly simple way to access your [stikkits][] from your Dashboard. I find it pretty convenient.


Building
--------

Build it using Dashcode. 'Nuff said.


Bugs & Ideas
------------

Fixes and improvements are always welcome. The best way to contribute is to [file a ticket][] at our [lighthouse][], and then fork the project on [github][] with a potential fix.
